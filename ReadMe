# Phase-Matching Function (PMF) Optimization

This repository contains code for optimizing second-order nonlinear materials to develop bright and broadband entangled photon sources. The project leverages genetic algorithms to optimize the phase-matching function (PMF) of nonlinear crystals, crucial for enhancing the performance of quantum light sources used in applications like quantum imaging and metrology.

## Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the nonlinear profiles of crystals segmented into domains, each with an orientation of +1 or -1. The goal is to find the optimal configuration that aligns with a target PMF. The challenge lies in navigating the large, non-convex solution space to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the computed and target PMFs.
